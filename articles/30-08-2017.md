# How to code in your free time
Every morning when I wake up I feel the itch to write some particular piece of software (3 actually).
I go to work thinking that as soon as I finish my job tasks I'll sink my teeth into these delicious tasks I contrived for myself.
Every evening I come home and play a video-game or watch a TV series and 
every night just before I fall asleep I remember these projects, but its too late.
Repeat.

The problem is trivial, the answer is simple: Just plan a one-hour coding session.
This could be one hour a day or one hour a week-end, but it has to be regular.
If you plan this and respect this schedule you will start moving, slowly but surely
