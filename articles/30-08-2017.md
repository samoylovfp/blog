# How to code in your free time
Every morning when I wake up I feel the itch to write some particular piece of software (3 actually).
I go to work thinking that as soon as I finish my job tasks I'll sink my teeth into these delicious tasks I contrived for myself.
Every evening I come home and play a video-game or watch a TV series and
